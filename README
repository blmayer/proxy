proxy
=====

	A simple proxy to terminate TLS connections

Why
---

This proxy will receive TLS requests with SNI and perform the handshake using
certificates from a folder and will forward that connection to the requested
server without TLS.


Using
-----

This program needs a folder with certificate files and one file named addr.
The default directory is ./certs. Inside this folder create one folder for
each domain supported, i.e. ./certs/example.com/. And place the following
files inside it:

- fullchain.pem: The X509 certificate chain in pem format.
- privkey.pem: The X509 private key in pem format.
- addr: a file containing the port number to be forwarded.

The forward address is localhost, only this address is supported now.


Options
-------

There are some CLI options that can be passed, run proxy --help for the list.


Roadmap
-------

- Support yaml config file
- Support different forward addresses
