=====

	A simple proxy to terminate TLS connections

Why
---

This proxy will receive TLS requests with SNI and perform the handshake using
certificates from a folder and will forward that connection to the requested
server without TLS.


Using
-----

This program a JSON config file, the default location is 
~/.config/proxy/config.json. For each domain the following info is mandatory:

- domain: The name of the domain.
- toport: The port number to forward connections.
- fullchain: The path to X509 certificate chain in pem format.
- privatekey: The path to X509 private key in pem format.

And the port number for incoming connections. The forward address is localhost,
only this address is supported now.


Options
-------

There are some CLI options that can be passed, run proxy --help for the list.
